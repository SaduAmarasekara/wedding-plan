                <h3>WEDDINGS</h3>
                <p>
                    A wedding is typically one of the most memorable days in a lifetime, one that people remember for years to come.
                    For most couples, regular pictures just won’t do. Wedding photography is much more than simply snapping a few pictures.
                    It is a one kind of art. Just tell us what you need and we will fulfill that..

                <h3>PRE SHOOTS</h3>
                <p>
                    A pre-shoot is a great way to get acquainted with being in front of the camera as many people haven’t had professional
                    photographs before - but it also gives me the perfect opportunity to see how you interact together, and capture the magical
                    moments between you both.

                <h3>BRIDAL SHOOTS</h3>
                <p>
                    A bridal portrait photoshoot is a picture session that involves the bride getting dolled up in her full bridal makeup,
                    hair and outfit and taking photos before the big day. They’re usually fashion-style shoots that involve the bride posing
                    against a minimalistic backdrop.

                <p>
                    A baby shower is basically a party which is thrown to celebrate the impending birth of a new baby. It’s also a way for
                    friends and family to help the new parents get everything they need. After all, babies need tons of stuff, and the list
                    can get quite expensive!
